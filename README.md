# CSS Colors and Colored Markers
 This is another project example of notation and how to read code while learning code and doing repetition.

 To use this project not for the code itself but as a good blueprint of what a beginning project should look like and as a reference for future projects.

 ##Inspiration for this project

 I wanted to do this project to practice coding and markdown.  It is a skill build that works two fold.  First, it forces me to practice coding and second it builds my notation skills on projects.  I am a firm believer in notation because I am human and have the attention span of a tse tse fly. Notation assists with the understanding of blueprints.

 Doing these mini projects helps me understand structure, presentation and shows my commitment to creating good code from building good habits.  As a brand new coder, I am taking these babysteps seriously so that I can become a force of change in the coding world.

 Growing up as a poor kid I did not have access to technology and had to sneak time on my school computer. I had to fight tooth and nail to get by.  I don't want others to suffer.  Please, help change that so that everyone has access to technology and that their lives can improve without struggling the way that I did. Just because I stuggled doesn't mean others have to.  If you can help, please, help.
